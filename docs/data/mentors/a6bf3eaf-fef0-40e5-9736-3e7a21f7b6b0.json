      "comment": "导师能力：Prof. Kim is an expert in composite mechanics and has extensive knowledge in functional composite as well. He also has a research direction of battery. It's worth noting that although he was not major in this area during his PhD study, he can still manage to learn all the basic knowledge in terms of the battery research and has no problem guiding the daily research and managing the future research direction of his students. He always review students' manuscripts in detail and helps to polish the English and structure of the manuscripts quite well before submission to a peer reviewed journal, which is commendable because not so many chair Professors are willing to do that. You are certainty difficult to publish paper on journals like Nature or Science in his group but you can get your works published in top journals like AEM, AFM, ACS Nano etc. as long as you work hard. Therefore, he should get a high rating in this section. 经费发放：His research funding is not so much compared to other chair Professors. With the funding, you can do daily experiments and basic characterizations for your research without any problem. There's certainly no doubt to get your salary paid each month. Still, you can't spend money as much as you want on buying expensive experimental equipment so you need to rely on the existing equipment most of the time, which is fairly enough if you don't plan to do something really big. 与学生关系：All the relations between the students and Prof. Kim is about academics. He will not interfere your personal affairs. You will have no problem to graduate on time as long as you meet the standard regarding academics. Sometimes students have arguments with him (i.e. whether or not to do Post-doc) but finally they still can graduate on time. In other words, personal grudges have nothing to do with academics, focus on your own research and everything will run smoothly. 学生毕业去向：You will get a good training regarding academics when you graduate in this group so that you are pretty suitable to find a Professorship. However, there's no good connection between this group and the enterprise/industry. You may rely on your own to explore your future if you choose a career in industry instead of academics. There are alumnus working as Professor at both HK and mainland China. Also I've heard about individuals chose to work beyond academics but not so often. One of them found a job in Apple many years ago.",
